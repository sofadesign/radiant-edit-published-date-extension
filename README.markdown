# Edit Published Date

Adds admin controls that allow editing published date of pages.

Based on [Edit Pages extension](http://mat.cc/dev/index.cgi/page_edit_dates/).

Instead of using this extension, you should also enable the Radiant built-in date field by setting the `page.edit.published_date?` like [described here](http://wiki.github.com/radiant/radiant/change-a-pages-publication-date).
